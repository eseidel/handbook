Note: We've not had anyone join yet, so I'm sure it's incomplete so far.

Welcome to Shorebird!  We're *extremely* glad you're here.

This guide is here to walk you through your first (days).

If you have any problems, please email Eric!

# Days before
* You should get an email from Rippling after signing your offer letter.  This
will include instructions on how to set up your Rippling account and thus begin
the digital parts of the onboarding process.
* A laptop should have been delivered to your home address already.

Our customers are primarily on Windows and targeting Android devices.  You
should have access to a Windows device, even if it's not your primary device.
Best if it's your primary device, but it's most important that you feel
productive on whatever you're using.

# Day you join
* There will be some tax paperwork to sign and identity verification to do before
you're legally allowed to start working.  Eric and Rippling will walk you through that.
* Eric will need to add you to the GitHub org as a Member or Owner if needed.


# Days after you join
* A corporate credit card will be delivered later this week if you need any
  other equipment.

## Accounts

* Your GSuite account should have been created as part of the Rippling onboarding process.
* You will use your existing GitHub account, but you will be added to the
  Shorebird organization.
* You will use your existing Discord account, but you will be added to the
  Shorebird server.

# Communication

* You should have been added to the Shorebird Discord server.  Please join and
  introduce yourself.  You will be added to the "Birder" role and you will
  have admin powers on the Discord.
* You should consider muting Discord, except for @mentions.  If Discord ends up
  too noisy, we'll find something quieter for internal communication.
* You have an email address, but don't expect to use it a ton.  We're too little
  to need to email each other much.
* You have a calendar, but also don't plan to use it a ton.  Eric has meetings
  with the outside world, but the rest of the company shouldn't need to meet
  much yet.

# Forms
* There are a few tax forms required to fill out on your first day.  In the US
  that's W-4 and W-9.  Rippling will help you take care of this.
* If you have an iPhone you can use the "Notes" app to scan the signed documents
  as pdfs.  Android likely has something similar.

# Finances
* Paychecks are delivered every 2 weeks.  You should have received a direct
  deposit form.  Please fill it out and return it to Eric.

# Code

* Once you've been added to the Shorebird organization on GitHub, you should
  clone both the internal and public repositories and play around.

# Product
* Please try the product (if you haven't already).  We are here to build
  something people want.  What have you seen customers need in trying to use
  Flutter/Dart?  We should build that.  We keep a list of customer pain in the
  Handbook, please feel free to add to it.

# Please edit the handbook
* I'm sure there is a ton missing from this onboarding guide and the handbook
  more generally.  Please send at least one PR to the handbook.  I'm sure you
  learned things through onboarding the next person should know.
